# üå°Ô∏è Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System

This project monitors environmental temperature and humidity using an Arduino Nano and a DHT11 sensor. The readings are continuously checked and transmitted over Bluetooth to a smartphone using the Serial Bluetooth Terminal app. This setup is ideal for remote monitoring of atmospheric conditions in indoor environments like plant enclosures or greenhouses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The **DHT11** sensor continuously reads temperature and humidity values from the surrounding environment.
2. These values are processed by the **Arduino Nano** in real time.
3. The sensor readings are sent over Bluetooth via the **HC-05** module to a smartphone.
4. You can view the data on your phone using the **Serial Bluetooth Terminal** app (available on Android).
