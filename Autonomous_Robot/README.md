# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Robot

This Arduino Unoâ€“powered robot autonomously navigates its environment using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. It detects obstacles and intelligently maneuvers around them using differential steering and a scanning algorithm. The robot continuously moves forward and re-routes itself when an obstacle is encountered, making it ideal for basic autonomous navigation experiments.

## ðŸš— How It Works

1. **Forward Movement**:  
   The robot drives forward at full speed by default.

2. **Obstacle Detection**:  
   If the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle within **30 cm**, the robot pauses.

3. **Scanning Mechanism**:  
   The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor through a set of angles (60Â° to 120Â°), measuring distance at each position.

4. **Decision Making**:  
   The robot determines the direction with the most clearance and steers accordingly using differential motor control (via L298N).

5. **Avoidance**:  
   A brief reverse and turn maneuver is executed before resuming forward movement in the new direction.

## ðŸ’» Code Summary

- **Sensor Angles**: The servo scans predefined angles in both directions to map out nearby space.
- **Distance Logic**: If any scanned distance is below `SAFE_DISTANCE`, an avoidance routine is triggered.
- **Motor Control**: Each side's motors are independently driven using PWM and direction pins to allow precise turning and reversing.

The behavior is fully autonomous â€” no remote control or manual intervention required.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The project uses direct wiring without a breadboard.
- Ensure proper power management when using Li-ion batteries for motors.
- Pin configuration and logic can be easily modified for customized navigation strategies.
