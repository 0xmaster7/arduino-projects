# ðŸ”Œ Arduino Projects

This repository contains a variety of Arduino-based projects developed for learning and experimentation with embedded systems, automation, and hardware-software integration. Each project explores different sensors, actuators, and logic implementations, focusing on practical applications and hands-on hardware control.

Projects in this repository demonstrate:
- Use of microcontrollers like Arduino Uno and Nano
- Sensor integration (e.g., DHT11, ultrasonic sensors)
- Motor control using drivers like L298N
- Real-time Bluetooth data communication
- Autonomous decision-making logic for robotics

All code and documentation are organized within their respective folders. This repository serves as a personal archive of hands-on Arduino work and a reference for future development.
